#  House Price Prediction

A **Machine Learning + Streamlit** project to predict house prices based on key features such as area, rooms, location, and more.  
The project includes **data preprocessing**, **model training**, **evaluation metrics**, and an **interactive web app** for real-time predictions.

---

##  Features
-  Data preprocessing & cleaning  
-  Machine Learning pipeline using **scikit-learn**  
-  Model evaluation with accuracy, MAE, RMSE, R²  
-  Interactive **Streamlit web app** for real-time predictions  
-  Simple & beautiful user interface
